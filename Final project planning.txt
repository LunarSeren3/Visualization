## Band depth ##
Measure of centrality, of a function among an ensemble of functions.

Ensemble of n functions, Band depth of degree j is:
Probability that the function will be enclosed within a band formed by j many randomly selected other functions from the ensemble.
The functions considered are the visible portions of functions in a given graphical view of the ensemble.

* Inclusion in band:
g(x) ⊂ B(f_1(x), ... , f_j(x)) ⇔ 
{∀x ∈ D: 
min[k=1,··· , j]f_k(x) ≤ g(x) ≤ max[k=1,··· , j] f_k(x)}.

"a function g(x) is in the band formed by functions f_1 through f_j(x)
means that
for all x in the windowed domain, the minimum of the values of functions f_1 through f_j at x is less or equal than the value of g at x and the maximum of the values of functions f_1 through f_j is greater or equal than the value of g at x."

* Band depth of degree j:
BD_j(g(x)) = Prob[g(x)⊂B(f_i_1(x), · · · , f_i_j(x))], 1≤ i_1 ≤ · · · , ≤ i_j ≤ n

"The probability that g is in the band formed by j many randomly selected functions from the ensemble."

"Is in band: ⊂ B" is a binary random variable. Prob[] is a fraction of the possible
j-degree bands that g(x) is "in the band".

* Robust band depth of order J:
The sum of band depths of degree j where j iterates from 2 to J.
BD_J(g(x) =Σ[j=2, J] BD_j(g(x))

* Modified ("Fuzzy") band depth:  not restricted to binary band depth.
Fuzzy_Inclusion(g, B) = ?
"Portion of the domain where the value of g at x is between the min and max values of the band functions at x"
FBD_j(g(x)) = Σ(Fuzzy_Inclusion(g, B))


## Generalization of Band Depth for Multivariate Curves ##
Express multivariate functions by parametrization.

* We define the band in multiple output dimensions using convex hull.
Convex hull of points in the codomain (multivariate values of the functions) at the same value of s <parameter> in the domain.

To define a convex hull, we need to start at degree d+1 for bands, where d is the number of dimensions of the output. For a single-output function g(x) → y, we need only two functions to form a band. For a 2D value function g(t) → (x, y) a curve traced in a 2D plane, we need a minimum of 3 degree band. The convex hull is shaped like a simplex (triangle, tetrahedron, five-cell simplex, etc.)
